## Project Portfolio Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis.I'm using Linnerud from scikit-learn.org. The Linnerud dataset is a classic dataset that is often used in statistical analysis and machine learning. This dataset originated from a study conducted by Linnerud in 1967, which aimed to study the relationship between physical activity (exercise) and physiological conditions (physiological) in a group of individuals.
I'm using The dataset from this link : https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html#linnerrud-dataset

The Linnerud dataset is a multi-output regression dataset consisting of:Input Variables (Exercise):Chins: The number of chin-ups (pull-ups) that can be performed, Situps: Number of sit-ups that can be performed, Jumps: Number of jumps that can be performed. Target Variable (Physiological): Weight: Body weight (in pounds), Waist: Waist circumference (in inches), Pulse: Pulse rate (in beats per minute). This dataset contains 20 observations (samples) of 20 middle-aged men who are members of a fitness club.

**Goals**:
1.Demonstration of Multi-Output Regression Algorithm:
  This dataset has 3 target variables (Weight, Waist, Pulse) that can be predicted based on 3     input variables (Chins, Situps, Jumps). 
  Suitable for testing regression algorithms that support multi-output, such as Linear            Regression, Random Forest, or SVR.
2.Study the Relationship between Physical Activity and Health:
  This dataset can be used to analyze how physical activities (such as chin-ups, sit-ups, and     jumps) affect physiological conditions (such as body weight, waist circumference, and pulse     rate).
3.Education and Training:
  This dataset is often used in courses or tutorials to teach regression concepts, data           normalization, and model evaluation.

**Insights**:
1.Relationship between Physical Activity and Physiological Conditions:
  Is there a correlation between the number of chin-ups, sit-ups, and jumps and body weight,      waist circumference, or pulse rate? For example, do people who do more sit-ups tend to have     smaller waistlines?
2.Patterns or Trends:
  Are there certain patterns in the data, such as groups of individuals with high physical        activity having better physiological conditions?
3.Outliers or Anomalies:
  Are there any data inconsistencies or outliers that need to be addressed?

**Advices**:
a. Data Preprocessing
Normalization or Standardization:
Since the scales of the input (Chins, Situps, Jumps) and target (Weight, Waist, Pulse) variables are different, perform data normalization or standardization.      Outlier Handling:
Check if there are outliers in the data and consider handling them (e.g., by removing or changing the outlier values).
b. Exploratory Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:
Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for each variable.                                                          Data Visualization:
Use visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, or heatmaps to understand relationships between variables.
